ECHMET Data Import Infrastructure
===

Introduction
---
ECHMET Data Import Infrastructure (EDII) is a pluginable framework for import of chromatographic and electrophoretic experimental data from various sources. It is designed to run as a separate background service. Communication with other software is accomplished via IPC interfaces. Pluginable architecture allows for easy addition of support for new data formats. Individual plugins may use Qt5 toolkit to provide GUI interface. 

Supported data formats through built-in plugins
---
EDII is shipped with the following plugins that allow import of the following data formats
- Agilent (HP) ChemStation / OpenLab
- ASC text file (Beckman-Coulter 32Karat, EZChrom)
- Comma separated values (CSV) 
- NetCDF (currently tested only with 32Karat output)

Suported IPC interfaces
---
- Local TCP socket (everywhere)
- [D-Bus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/) (Linux)

Dependencies
---
EDII depends on the following toolkits and libraries in order to be built and run
- [Qt 5 toolkit](https://www.qt.io/)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)

Plugin dependencies
---
#### HPCSSupport
- [libHPCS](https://github.com/echmet/libHPCS)

#### NetCDFSupport
- [NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/)

#### ASCSupport
- [ICU](http://site.icu-project.org/home)

Building
---
EDII relies on the CMake build system to generate appropriate make or project files.

### Build parameters
- `-DEDII_PLUGIN_ENABLE_ASC=ON|OFF` - Whether to build ASCSupport plugin, defaults to `ON`
- `-DEDII_PLUGIN_ENABLE_CSV=ON|OFF` - Whether to build CSVSupport plugin, defaults to `ON`
- `-DEDII_PLUGIN_ENABLE_HPCS=ON|OFF` - Whether to build HPCSSuport plugin, defaults to `ON`
- `-DEDII_PLUGIN_ENABLE_NETCDF=ON|OFF` - Whether to build NetCDFSuport plugin, defaults to `ON`

### Build parameters of built-in plugins
#### ASCSupport
- `-DICU_ROOT=` Path to ICU installation, if an ICU installation is not available in system-wide directories

#### HPCSSupport
- `-DLIBHPCS_DIR=` Path to libHPCS installation if not available in system-wide directories

#### NetCDFSupport
- `-DLIBNETCDF_DIR=` Path to NetCDF installation if not available in system-wide directories

<a name="Linux_UNIX"></a>
#### Linux/UNIX
`cd` to the directory with EDII sources and run the following sequence of commands

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
	make

#### Windows
Use `CMake-gui` tool to set up the project and generate project files for your compiler of choice. Keep in  mind that since Qt5 exports C++ objects, EDII must be built with the same compiler that was used to build your Qt5 toolkit. Refer to the [Linux/UNIX](#Linux_UNIX) section of this README for details how to set up paths for the required dependencies.


Writing custom plugins
---
See [`EDII\include\plugins`](https://github.com/echmet/EDII/tree/master/include/plugins) directory for header files describing the API that an EDII plugin shall expose. Keep in mind that since EDII is a C++/Qt-based project, the plugin must be built by the same compiler and linked against the same libraries as EDII itself.
